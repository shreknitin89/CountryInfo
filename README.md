# CountryInfo
This repo is [Nitin Dasari's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-d/) take home assignment solution

## Requirements:
1. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases) Dolphin and above
2. AGP 7.3 and Gradle 7.4
3. Java 11 and Kotlin 1.7.10

## Notes
1. The app follows MVVM architecture and multi-module project structure with Repos being the data source and ViewModels being the presentation logic
2. All the necessary dependencies have been injected into their respective classes using modules generated by Koin. All the modules are in `di` package
3. Both the `domain` and `data` modules are pure kotlin library modules so there is no android code bleeding into those modules
4. A separate domain models were constructed to keep the ui models abstracted away from data layer
5. All the view states were sent to Views using Sealed class/interface state management
6. Communication between the fragments is done using a shared AndroidViewModel
7. Navigation between fragment is done via Navigation components `nav_graph`
8. Universal List Adapter has been used to draw the list on recycler view. That way it is easy to maintain in future and adheres to Open Closed Principle
9. All the dependencies in tests were injected using Mockito mocks and flows were tested using Turbine alongside JUnit4 and Coroutines
